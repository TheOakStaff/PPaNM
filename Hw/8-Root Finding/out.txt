The initial value is (x, y) = (0, 3)
The minimum should be at (x, y)= (1, 1)
The minimum is found at (x, y) = (-0.248553, 0.0667562),

The final value differs from the actual value. However, plotting thefunction using Wolfram-Alpha reveals that the 'valley floor' is rather extencive.
As such, our value of likely lies in an area where the 
rate of change is too low for our function to handle with 'my' current processign power
