Here we find the minimum value of x²+x which should be -0.5
fx =
-0.5 

Here we find the minimum value of x²+y² which should be 0,0
fx =
0 0 

The initial value is (x, y) = (0, 3)
The minimum should be at (x, y)= (1, 1)
The minimum is found at (x, y) = (-0.248553, 0.0667562),

The final value differs from the actual value. However, plotting thefunction using Wolfram-Alpha[1] reveals that the 'valley floor' is rather extencive.
As such, our value of likely lies in an area where the 
rate of change is too low for our function to handle
